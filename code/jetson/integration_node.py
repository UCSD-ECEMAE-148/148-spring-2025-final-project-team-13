"""
ROS 2 Integration Node: Subscribes to /voice_cmd_twist and /stop_cmd_twist,
and publishes the final Twist to /cmd_vel.  

Logic:
  - If /stop_cmd_twist publishes a Twist with linear.x == 0.0 (and angular.z == 0.0),
    this node continuously publishes a zero Twist to /cmd_vel (emergency stop).
  - Otherwise, it publishes the most recent Twist from /voice_cmd_twist to /cmd_vel.
